ðŸš€ Project Overview
EngineMind is a real-time AI diagnostic assistant designed for internal combustion or turbine engines. It uses telemetry data (temperature, RPM, pressure, vibrations) to predict potential failures before they happen. Built to integrate with IoT sensor streams and deliver actionable alerts for aerospace or automotive use.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Trained on simulated and real engine telemetry logs.

Uses LSTM and anomaly detection models.

Outputs fault codes, maintenance suggestions, and estimated time to failure.

Optimized for Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano deployment with edge inference.

ðŸ”¨ Stack
Python / PyTorch / FastAPI

Google Colab for training + deployment prototype

TensorRT for model compression

MQTT for real-time messaging
